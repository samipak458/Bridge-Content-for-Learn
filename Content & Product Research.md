# Content Research

In the first month, our team go through each module of [Get started with Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/healthcare-in-a-day/) learning path. After doing detailed research on each module, we find out in module [Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/healthcare-overview/?ns-enrollment-type=learningpath&ns-enrollment-id=learn-bizapps.healthcare-in-a-day) there is a requirement of one more unit.
