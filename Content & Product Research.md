# Content Research

In the first month, our team go through each module of [Get started with Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/healthcare-in-a-day/) learning path. After doing detailed research on each module, we find out in module [Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/healthcare-overview/?ns-enrollment-type=learningpath&ns-enrollment-id=learn-bizapps.healthcare-in-a-day) there is a requirement of one more unit. That unit will help beginners/students in better understanding of **Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare**.

## About Unit
We have decided to change ***Introduction*** unit's heading to ***Introduction to Microsoft Cloud Heathcare Service*** and add an additional unit before it, named as ***Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare***. In _Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare_, we have briefly described that "what is Microsoft Cloud Computing" and "what is Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare" along with short videos. 

We have took the refrence of the proposed content from the following links:
